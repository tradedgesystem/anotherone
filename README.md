# Dirt Track Racing Prototype (Unity 2022 LTS)

This repo contains C# scripts and setup notes for a minimal 3D Supercross-style dirt track prototype with a player bike, AI opponent, checkpointed laps, and HUD timers.

See [`UNITY_SETUP.md`](UNITY_SETUP.md) for step-by-step instructions on importing the scripts into your `Assets/` folder and assembling the scene.
